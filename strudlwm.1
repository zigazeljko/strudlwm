.SH SYNOPSIS
.B strudlwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
strudlwm is a stacking window manager for X, based on dwm.
.P
(note: this manpage is incomplete).
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
Each screen contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the
layout, the title of the focused window, and the text read from the root window
name property, if the screen is focused. A floating window is indicated with an
empty square and a maximised floating window is indicated with a filled square
before the windows title.  The selected tags are indicated with a different
color. The tags of the focused window are indicated with a filled square in the
top left corner.  The tags which are applied to one or more windows are
indicated with an empty square in the top left corner.
.P
strudlwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

.SH BUGS
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. Possible workarounds
are using JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or setting the
environment variable
.BR AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
(to use the older Motif backend instead) or running
.B xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D
or
.B wmname LG3D
(to pretend that a non-reparenting window manager is running that the
XToolkit/XAWT backend can recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the environment variable
.BR _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 .
.P
GTK 2.10.9+ versions contain a broken
.BR Save\-As
file dialog implementation,
which requests to reconfigure its window size in an endless loop. However, its
window is still respondable during this state, so you can simply ignore the flicker
until a new GTK version appears, which will fix this bug, approximately
GTK 2.10.12+ versions.
