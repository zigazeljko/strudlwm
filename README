strudlwm
============================
strudlwm is an extremely fast and small stacking/tiling window manager for X, based od dwm.


Requirements
------------
In order to build strudlwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit Makefile to match your local setup (strudlwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install strudlwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running strudlwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start strudlwm using startx:

    exec strudlwm

In order to connect strudlwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec strudlwm

(This will start strudlwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec strudlwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of strudlwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
